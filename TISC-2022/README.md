This challenge was made for [The InfoSecurity Challenge](https://www.csit.gov.sg/events/tisc/tisc-2022) (TISC) 2022, a 17-day CTF hosted by the [Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies](https://www.csit.gov.sg/).

It appeared in Level 5/10, and was solved by 13 participants.

**Topics**: Web Exploitation - SQL Injection, HTTP Request Smuggling, and XS Leaks.

**Anticipated Time Taken**: > 6 hours

## Setup

Go to the `service` directory and `docker-compose up -d`.

## Challenge Statement

We have discovered PALINDROME's secret portal, but we can't seem to gain access. Thankfully, we managed to steal the source code - can you take a look?

Gaining access to the portal and stealing the PALINDROME admin's access token will greatly aid our efforts to curb PALINDROME's ongoing attack.

## Flag

The flag is the admin's access token - `TISC{1:3:3:7:l:3:4:k:1:n}`

## Provided Files

All files under `distrib`.
